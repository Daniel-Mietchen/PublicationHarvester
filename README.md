PublicationHarvester: An open-source software tool for science policy research that gathers and analyzes PubMed bibliographic data

The Publication Harvester is a software tool that downloads publications from PubMed, stores them in a database, and generates an accurate count of publications for a set of people. The harvester uses a set of possible name variations for that individual, and records the list of authors. The goal of the software is to gather large amounts of data about specific people from PubMed for statistical analysis. It records the people, publications and publication data in a database, and generates reports based on that data.

It consists of several different components:
* PublicationHarvester: http://www.stellman-greene.com/PublicationHarvester/
* SC/Gen and SocialNetworking: http://www.stellman-greene.com/SCGen/
* FindRelated: http://www.stellman-greene.com/FindRelated/

It is also related to the ScientificDistance project: http://www.stellman-greene.com/ScientificDistance/
